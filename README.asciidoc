 * There is also a Google Group which is mostly defunct now: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nz
 * Please ask to be added to the github organisation, where you can add and contribute content.

Plans
-----

I'm just hoping to share interesting content, whilst growing the community and meeting cool people. I'd like to borrow ideas from other groups around the world.

Cory Lanou of Denver Gophers has some great advice about running meetups: https://github.com/corylanou/go-meetup/blob/master/README.md . I've even been to see them, they're amazing.
 
San Diego Gophers have a github 'org', an approach which I'm copying right now: https://github.com/SDGophers
